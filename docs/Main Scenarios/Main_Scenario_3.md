# Main Scenario 3  
## Instant Booking with Guaranteed Availability  

**Description**:  
A user wants to secure equipment immediately without waiting for owner approval, relying on pre-verified listings and transparent terms for a frictionless experience.

1. The user performs a search with filters and identifies an item marked with **"Instant Book"** (available for high-trust owners).  
2. The detailed view shows **full price breakdown** (rental fee, insurance, delivery, taxes) and confirmed availability for the selected dates.  
3. The user selects dates, adds optional services, and taps **"Book Now"**.  
4. The system **reserves the item instantly**, processes payment, and locks the calendar to prevent double-booking.  
5. The user receives an **immediate confirmation** with QR code, pickup/delivery details, and contact-free access instructions (if applicable).  
6. The owner is notified of the confirmed booking and prepares the item; no manual approval required.  
7. Post-rental, the user is prompted to **submit a condition report and review**.
