# Main Scenario 4  
## Advance Booking for Future Dates  

**Description**:  
A user plans ahead and reserves equipment for a specific future period, ensuring availability and clear terms well in advance of the activity.

**Scenario Flow**:  
1. The user searches for equipment and filters by **future dates** (e.g., 2–8 weeks ahead).  
2. Results highlight items with **confirmed availability** for the selected period, including long-term booking options.  
3. The user reviews **detailed policies**: cancellation window, deposit, delivery scheduling, and condition guarantees.  
4. The user submits a **reservation request** with preferred pickup/delivery method.  
5. The owner reviews and **confirms within 24 hours**; the booking is locked upon acceptance.  
6. The user receives a **calendar invite**, reminder notifications, and pre-rental checklist 48 hours before pickup.  
7. On the rental start date, the item is made available as agreed; return is tracked via automated reminders.
