# Main Scenario 2  
## List Equipment for Rental  

**Description**:  
An equipment owner with unused sports gear lists one or more items on the platform to generate passive income, defining availability, pricing, and protection terms with minimal effort.

**Scenario Flow**:  
1. The owner navigates to the **owner dashboard** and selects **"List New Item"**.  
2. The owner uploads clear photos and selects the item from a **pre-defined catalog** or enters custom details (brand, model, condition).  
3. The owner sets **rental price per day**, **availability calendar**, pickup/delivery preferences, and enables **optional damage protection**.  
4. The system generates a public listing with auto-filled specifications and owner credibility badge (based on response rate and ratings).  
5. The listing goes live immediately and appears in relevant search results.  
6. The owner receives **real-time notifications** for incoming rental requests and can approve with one tap.  
7. After rental completion and verified return, earnings are **automatically transferred** to the owner’s account.
