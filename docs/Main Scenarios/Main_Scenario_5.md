# Main Scenario 5  
## Group Booking for Multiple Items  

**Description**:  
A user organizes an activity for a group and rents multiple coordinated items in a single transaction, ensuring availability, unified logistics, and streamlined communication.

**Scenario Flow**:  
1. The user initiates a **"Group Booking"** from the homepage or search results.  
2. The user defines **group size**, **activity type**, **dates**, and **location**, then browses recommended bundles or builds a custom cart.  
3. The system displays **combined availability**, bulk pricing (if applicable), and delivery/pickup options for all items.  
4. The user reviews **unified terms** (one insurance policy, single delivery window, group contact person).  
5. The booking is submitted; involved owners receive **synchronized requests** and confirm individually or via batch approval.  
6. Upon full confirmation, the user completes **one payment** and receives a **shared trip dashboard** with item trackers, checklists, and group messaging.  
7. After return, a single **group review and condition report** closes the rental cycle.
