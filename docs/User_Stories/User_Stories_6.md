## US11 - Set Seasonal Availability

- As an owner
- I want to define seasonal or limited availability windows
- So that the item only appears when I’m not using it.

- Owner blocks personal dates or seasons.
- Only available periods appear in search results.
- System prevents bookings outside the defined availability.
