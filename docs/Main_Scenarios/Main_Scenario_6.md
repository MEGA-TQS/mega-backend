# Main Scenario 6  
## Occasional Owner Rents Out Rarely-Used Equipment  

**Description**:  
An owner possesses sports equipment used only a few times per year (e.g., seasonal or specialized gear). During idle periods, they make the item available for rental to offset ownership costs and generate supplemental income with minimal ongoing effort.

**Scenario Flow**:  
1. The owner accesses the **owner dashboard** and selects **"Add Seasonal Item"** or updates an existing listing.  
2. The owner defines **limited usage windows** (e.g., “available June–August only” or “weekends except July 15–20”) using a visual calendar with drag-to-block personal dates.  
3. The system auto-suggests **competitive pricing** based on local demand, item rarity, and past rental performance; the owner adjusts or accepts.  
4. The owner enables **smart availability toggles**: “Auto-pause after my bookings” and “Require 48h buffer between rentals” to protect personal use and maintenance time.  
5. The listing appears in searches only during open periods; incoming requests arrive via **prioritized push notification** with renter summary (rating, purpose, group size).  
6. The owner reviews and **approves/declines in under 30 seconds**; approved bookings auto-block personal calendar dates.  
7. Post-rental, the system prompts the renter for **condition photos**; upon verified return, earnings (minus platform fee) are **deposited within 24 hours**.  
8. At season end, the owner taps **“Pause Until Next Year”**—the listing hides automatically and reactivates on the preset date.
