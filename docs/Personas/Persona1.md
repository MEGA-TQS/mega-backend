## Background  
Alberto has been a long-time sports enthusiast. Over the years, he collected a wide range of sports gear—surfboards, kayak equipment, mountain bikes, and football training accessories. Much of it is underused, especially outside training seasons. He is looking for ways to make his gear useful and earn extra income with minimal effort.
 

## Daily Life  
- Teaches physical education during weekdays

- Coaches a youth football team in the afternoons

- Does weekend rides and occasional kayaking trips

- Organizes his equipment in a home garage

- Uses his phone frequently to check messages from students, parents, and sports groups


## Goals & Needs  
- Earn passive income from unused sports gear

- Make sure his equipment is handled responsibly

- An easy, low-maintenance system to manage rental scheduling

- Clear information about who is renting his gear

- Secure payments and protection against damages


## Pain Points & Challenges  
- Concern about gear being returned damaged or late

- Doesn’t want time-consuming back-and-forth with renters

- Needs a simple way to track bookings

- Limited patience for complicated apps or long forms

- Wants assurance his gear won’t be lost or stolen
  

## Motivation  
- Supplement monthly income
 
- Promote an active lifestyle in his community
 
- Reduce waste by sharing equipment rather than letting it sit unused
 
- Support young or beginner athletes who may not afford to buy gear
